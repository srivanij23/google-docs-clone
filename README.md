 **Google Docs Clone** üìÑ


A collaborative, real-time document editor built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io, aiming to replicate core functionalities of Google Docs, such as real-time editing, document storage, and collaborative text updates.

## Features
- **Real-Time Editing:** Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.
- **Collaborative Updates:** Edits from one user are reflected in real-time for all users.
- **Document Persistence:** Documents are saved to MongoDB, allowing users to retrieve them later.
- **Easy Setup:** Designed for easy local development and deployment.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** :üåÄ
   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-docs-clone.git
   cd google-docs-clone
   
2. Install dependencies:
npm install
3.Setup MongoDB: Ensure MongoDB is running locally (usually on localhost:27017). Create a database called google-docs-clone.
4.Run the application:
  npm start
5. This will start the server on http://localhost:3001.
6. 
    Usage :

   . Access the Application: Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser.

   . Create/Edit Document: Enter the document ID in the URL to edit a specific document, or start a new document.

   . Collaborate: Share the document link with others to collaborate in real-time.

Technologies Used üßë‚Äçüíª:

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with React)
    Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io
    Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema management)

API Endpoints

    /document/:id: Fetches or creates a new document based on ID.

Troubleshooting 

    MongoDB Connection Error: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on localhost:27017. Verify the connection string in server.js:

    javascript

    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/google-docs-clone', {
        useNewUrlParser: true,
        useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });

    Socket.io Issues: Ensure the Socket.io client is properly included in your front-end files. Check the client-side script path if you encounter connection issues.
